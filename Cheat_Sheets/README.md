#Grades:
1. GitHub: 10/10 Great job! Nice summary I like how you put things in your own words.
2. Python Basics: 10/10 Nice work! Next time I would consider adding some code examples to your text too.
3. Numpy: 9/10 a good overall summary but you didn't get to all of the questions and I would have liked to have seen lists of methods and attributes that come with numpy arrays. Next time feel free not to write this in paragraph form an outline may be an easier format.
