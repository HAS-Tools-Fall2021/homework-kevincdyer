Homework 9

1. My forecasts are generated through gathering the median flow data of every day in the month of October since 1989. I then subset the data, looking only at the median flows for days in October since 2012. Because of the unusually high amount of rainfall we've gotten this last month, I decided to take the max value of this subset of data for my week 1 prediction and got a value of 129.5 CFS. For my two week prediction, because of my foreseeing of the monsoon season's end, I took the median value of the subset of data since 2012 years and got a value of 117.5 CFS.

2. I added the precipitation datasets of Sedona airport and Flagstaff Arizona to compliment my flow data. I chose precipitation data because it is pertinent to the amount of flow streams get in the surrounding areas. I got this data from the Mesonet website using an API to get direct, up-to-data information.
