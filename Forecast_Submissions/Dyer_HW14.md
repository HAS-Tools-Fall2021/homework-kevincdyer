3/3: Great job! I'm gald you found this experience useful even though you were not able to get things running.  Not writing good readme's and not clearly documenting what needs to be installed and how are some of the most common pitfalls that people run into so I think your experience, while not positive, is unforutnately quite representative.

1. The paper I chose was named the "Making of the New European Wind Atlas" and is from the European Geosciences Union. It describes the sensitivity
analysis and evaluation procedures used as a basis for deciding the final setup of the mesoscale model simulations of the European Wind Atlas.
2. The code associated with this article is listed here on GitHub: https://github.com/newa-wind. The article includes a link to a GitHub repo.
3. Understanding how to run the code from this repo was a real chore. The ReadMe provided barely any useful information and the documentation within
the code itself was pretty much none-existent besides a sentence at the beginning of each script describing its purpose.
4. The ReadMe was bare bones and completely unhelpful. It only provides the "code structure", which is basically a rudimentary map of what the code
outputs I believe. What I needed was order of running, where to access the data, and troubleshooting techniques. None were provided, and thus I couldn't
fix the roadblocks I encountered. For one, I don't believe I ran the right script first, as there was references to terms undefined within it.
Additionally, there was this package, "wrf" which I needed to install but could not manage to no matter what I did. In the end, I could run a few lines
of code, but couldn't even re-create a plot much less run the whole script successfully.
5. The data was stored in the repo, from what I could surmise. I could access it, but there was nothing noting its presence or placement in the ReadMe.
It did have a DOI, but that linked to a page with the GitHub link attached.
6. This experience taught me a lot about what not to do when I make my own journal articles. Recreating data is paramount in science, and if my readers
cannot follow my code clearly from my ReadMe and documentation, then I have failed as an author. Specifically, I will provide a clear order of
scripts to run if needed, ways of troubleshooting my code, and links to data locations.
