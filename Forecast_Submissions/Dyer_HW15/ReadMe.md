3/3: Great job. Glad you got it working! We'll talk more about your question tomorrow. 
_____________________________________________________________

1. What resources did you request on Puma? How long did you wait in the queue for your job to run and how long did it take to run?
   
   I requested the same resources we requested in class for our HelloWorld.py script. I waited only about 5 minutes in the queue and it ran almost immediately.

2. What was the most confusing part to you about setting up and running your job on Puma?
   
   The most confusing parts for me was navigating the GUI for the website, and changing my script to be able to run on Puma. It took many trial and error, mostly because of packages and data pathing, before I was able to have the script run.

3. What questions do you still have after doing this?
   
   The question lingering in my head is why the need for the submit script at all. It seems like its functions could be accomplished in the background and the whole process would be a lot more user friendly that way.

My one week prediction for average flow is 177.7 ft^3/s, and my two week prediction is 182.0 ft^3/s. Both predictions are based off the median flow rates of Camp Verde from the Month of October since 2011. The 1 week prediction is the max of this subset of data due to the unusually high amount of rainfall recently, and the two week preidction is the median of this subset of data.
