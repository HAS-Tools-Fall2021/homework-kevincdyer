2/3: Nice work
- I subtracted 1 point because I don't see your work in the python script you submitted.
- Also check the solution for question 4 to see how to calculate this explicitly
- Next time please add some formatting to your markdown

1. Month, day, year and flow are all list variables. They're all integers whose lengths depend on the extent of data one downloaded from the USGS website.

2. The flow was greater than my predicted amount of 94 in September 661 times since 1989. Which is 661/960 days or 69%.

3. The flow was greater than my predicted amount in September 366 times since 2000 (58%) and 202 times since 2010 (61%).

4. Generally, flow is faster in the first half of September than the latter half, likely due to changing precipitation rates.
