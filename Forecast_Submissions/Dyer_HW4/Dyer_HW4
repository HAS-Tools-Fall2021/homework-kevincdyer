Homework 2

1. Isolating the data for September from the last few years shows
a steady trend of decreased flow rates as time goes on as the monsoon
season ends. This is near constant for every September. Knowledge
of this helped me to form my prediction for the average flow rate
of this week being 85 cm^3/s. Though there is a slight chance of
rain at the end of this week in Camp Verde, I believe this to be
insignificant and that the trend will continue.

2. flow_data is a numpyarray composed of all flow data collected from
Camp Verde from 1/1/1989 till 9/18/2021. Using flow_data.shape we can
get its dimensions which are (11949, 4).

3. Flow exceeded my estimate in the month of September 769 times since
1989, or 80.1%

4.  Flow exceeded my estimate in the month of September since the year
2000 459 times, or 72.9%. Flow exceeded my estimate in the month of
September since the year 2010 248 times, or 75.15%.

5. Daily flow in the first half of September was greater than my
estimate of 85cm^3/s 386 times since 1989. While in the second half of
September it's greater 408 times.
